Create Full Stack (CFS) provides the glue between the libraries and frameworks. No more stitching together random blog posts guessing about best practices. Build scalable applications on a solid foundation.

Pre-requisites are [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install#global-install) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```bash
yarn create full-stack ~/my-full-stack
```

Follow the instructions generated in `~/my-full-stack/README.md` to complete the setup. Then try spinning up the full stack locally.

```bash
cd ~/my-full-stack
yarn start
```
